1) To generate a users controller for the api.

CODE: rails generate controller api::v1::users


2) To see all the routes(wrt a particular controller) and there uri format.

CODE: rails routes | grep users

This shows that we now have a path to our resources and can use the GET function.

3) HTTP CODE RESPONSES AND THEIR EQUIVALENT IN rails:
:success -> 200

:created -> 201 (the demand was met and resulted in the creation of a new resource after the POST requests.)

:unproccessable_entity -> 422 (the server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to process the contained instructions.)

:no_content -> 204 (a request has succeeded, but that the client doesn't need to navigate away from its current page. Used for PUT/DELETE)

4) PUT AND PATCH
PUT is used when we want to modify all the parameters of a resource.
PATCH is used to update some portion of the existing resource.
